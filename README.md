# NEXUS3 skins

NEXUS3 uses an open format to describe the colors and other properties of its UI, commonly refered to as "skins", in the form of json files.

This repository contains all these skins in its original form, so others can learn how to create their own skins for NEXUS3.

We accept pull requests for either new skins to be distributed or for modifications to our existing skins, as long as the code of conduct is followed and the quality of the submission is reasonably high.
