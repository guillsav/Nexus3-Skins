# Code of conduct

All skins have to follow these simple rules:

1) No nudity / porn 🐷
2) No extreme or realistic gore 💀
3) No religious or politicaly motivated content ⛪
4) No hate / extremist content 🪓
5) No brands / trademarks or copyrighted content ™

In other words: we have to be able to legally distribute these skins on our platform and our customers could be 13 years old.

We don't want to be perceived as supporting any specific religion, political party or cause.
We're very inclusive, so feel free to create LGBTQ+ skins etc.

We reserve the right to refuse pull requests and even ban users for repeated or gross violations of the conduct.
