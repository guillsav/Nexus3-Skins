# Welcome

Since you've found this file, you're probably interested in our Nexus3 skins and maybe into creating your very own. Good for you. We like to encourage creativity.

Looking into these files might be interesting, but we can do better. We created a public repository on GitHub you can explore that comes
with full examples and comments, showing you every single color and parameter you can tweak to create your very own skins.

You can find it here: https://github.com/reFX/Nexus3-Skins

It is a work in progress, so feel free to open issues, submit your own skins or make changes to ours and create a pull-request to request
to add your changes into the official repository, which will then be converted into offical skins to be released via our cloud app.
